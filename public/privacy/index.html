  <h3>Services Used by Grapevine</h3>
<p>Grapevine makes use of a number of third party services in order to operate a set of distinct features and process data. These third party services operate under their own privacy policies. By agreeing to Grapevine's privacy policy you are also agreeing to these third party vendor's privacy policies:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Google Analytics, provided by Google Inc. (<a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>). We use Google Analytics to better improve Grapevine by anonymously collecting some usage data. The anonymous usage data is not linked to any personally identifying information. The handling of identifiers for mobile devices (including Android Advertising ID and Advertising Identifier for iOS), is managed by the Google Analytics SDK. Google may use this identifier to deliver personalised advertisments within their advertising network. As this analytics data is required by Grapevine to improve our service, this cannot be disabled. If you do not want anonymous usage data to be collected about you, do not use Grapevine.</li>
	<li>Facebook Auth, Graph, Audience Network, provided by Facebook Inc. (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/405977429438260">Privacy Policy</a>). Grapevine only processes name and ID data for the authenticated user and their Friends whom have also authenticated Grapevine. Some friend data is saved to our servers in order for Grapevine to function as intended. Identifiers for mobile devices (including Android Advertising ID and Advertising Identifier for iOS) may be collected by the Facebook Audience Network in order to display targeted advertisments within their advertising network.</li>
  <li>OneSignal, owned and operated by Lilomi, Inc. (<a href="https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</a>). Grapevine uses OneSignal in order to send push notifications. In order for these to work as intended you have a notification identifier which is saved to our servers and this is used to send you personalised push notifications. If you have 'Friend Notifications' enabled within Grapevine, every message you send will also contain this identifier. Your identifier could potentially be used to identify you if required by law. If you do not want your identifier to be known, do not use Grapevine. The OneSignal SDK collects some information about you in order for the notifications to function properly and to improve their product. Please see OneSignal's <a href="https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy">privacy policy</a> to see exactly which data may be collected about you.
