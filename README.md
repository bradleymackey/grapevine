# Backchat (since renamed to Grapevine)

A little unpopular app I made for fun. Feel free to look and critique.

Terms of service and privacy policy apply to all installations. Find on the App Store. Simply search for 'Grapevine'.

MIT Licence, you will need to run `pod install` for yourself. Personal info has been retracted from the app (server keys and such), so this will not work if you build it yourself. Sorry.
